# Lex Slovik - Portfolio Project

## Objective
Create a deployed portfolio of work samples for a potential employer to review and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.
## Acceptance Criteria
- When the portfolio loads the viewer is presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
- The links in the navigation scroll to the corresponding section
- The link to the section about my work jumps to a section with titled images of my applications
- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices the viewer experiences a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport
